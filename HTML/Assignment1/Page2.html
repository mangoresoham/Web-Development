        <b>Tkinter</b> is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit,
        and is Python's de facto standard GUI. Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and macOS installs of Python. 
        The name Tkinter comes from Tk interface.

        In tic tac toe, a player wins if they have 3 of their symbols in one row, column, or diagonal. We can use Matrices for checking the conditions.
